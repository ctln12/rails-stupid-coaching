## Rails: Routing, Controllers & Views

Exercise from Le Wagon Full Stack Challenges

### Objective:

Implement a simple Rails application with 2 pages:

* First page (http://localhost:3000/ask) is a form with an input, where a user can type a question to ask the Coach

* After submitting the form, the user is redirected to a new page where she/he will see her/his question and the coach answer.

That's it!
